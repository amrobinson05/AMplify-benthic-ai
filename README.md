# Welcome to AMplify AI
We offer two fine-tuned deep learning models for marine life classification and detection.

Use the Classification model to identify benthic species in your photos, or the Detection model to locate and label organisms in full underwater scenes.
The models currently support seven benthic species: crab, eel, whelk, scallop, flatfish, roundfish, and skate.
